          <hr /> <h2>Disputes </h2>
          Any dispute or claim relating in any way to your use of any Precision
          Textile Color And Sophicolor Service through [www.sophicolor.com] will
          be resolved by binding arbitration. The Federal Arbitration Act and
          federal arbitration law apply to this agreement. There is no judge or
          jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is
          limited. However, an arbitrator can award on an individual basis the
          same damages and relief as a court (including injunctive and
          declaratory relief or statutory damages), and must follow the terms of
          these Terms and Conditions of Use as a court would. To begin an
          arbitration proceeding, you must send a letter requesting arbitration
          and describing your claim to [info@sophicolor.com]. The arbitration
          will be conducted by the American Arbitration Association (AAA) under
          its rules, including the AAA’s Supplementary Procedures for
          Consumer-Related Disputes, in Boston, Massachusetts. We each agree
          that any dispute resolution proceedings will be conducted only on an
          individual basis and not in a class, consolidated or representative
          action. If for any reason a claim proceeds in court rather than in
          arbitration we each waive any right to a jury trial. We also both
          agree that you or we may bring suit in court to enjoin infringement or
          other misuse of intellectual property rights.
          <hr /> <h2>Applicable Law </h2>
          <p>
            By using any Precision Textile Color Service, you agree that the
            Federal Arbitration Act, applicable federal law, and the laws of the
            Commonwealth of Massachusetts, without regard to principles of
            conflict of laws, will govern these Terms and Conditions of Use and
            any dispute of any sort that may arise between you and Precision
            Textile.
          </p>
          <hr /> <h2>Modification And Severability </h2>
          <p>
            We reserve the right to make changes to our site, policies, and
            these Terms and Conditions of Use at any time. If any of these terms
            or conditions shall be deemed invalid, void, or for any reason
            unenforceable, that condition shall be deemed severable and shall
            not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining
            condition.
