            Non-Personal Identification Information Automatically Collected

            We use cookies, pixel tags, and/or other similar technologies to
            collect non-personal identification information about you whenever
            you visit our Website. Non-personal identification information may
            include your browser name, your IP address, your type of computer
            and technical information about your means of connection to our
            Website, such as the operating system and the Internet Service
            Providers utilized, and other similar information.

            Your IP address is short for your “Internet Protocol address” and is
            a series of numbers that identifies each computer and machine
            connected to the Internet. An IP address enables a server on a
            computer network to send you the file that you have requested on the
            Internet. The IP address disclosed to us may identify the computer
            from which you are accessing the Internet, or a server owned by your
            Internet Service Provider. Because an IP Address is machine
            specific, rather than person specific, an IP address does not, in
            and of itself, identify you individually, but helps us to determine
            the frequency of visits to this Website and the popularity of its
            various pages and functions. We will not attempt to match any
            personally identifiable information that you provide to us with your
            IP address, unless there are reasonable grounds to believe that
            doing so would provide information that is relevant and material to
            a criminal investigation.

            In addition, we may use a tool called Google Analytics™ or other
            similar service to collect information about use of this site.
            Google Analytics collects information such as how often users visit
            this site, what pages they visit when they do so, and what other
            sites they used prior to coming to this site. We use the information
            we get from Google Analytics only to improve this site. Google
            Analytics collects only the IP address assigned to you on the date
            you visit this site, rather than your name or other identifying
            information. We do not combine the information collected through the
            use of Google Analytics with personally identifiable information.
            Although Google Analytics plants a persistent cookie on your web
            browser to identify you as a unique user the next time you visit
            this site, the cookie cannot be used by anyone but Google. The
            ability to use and share information collected by Google Analytics
            about your visits to this site is restricted by the Google Analytics
            Terms of Use and the Google Privacy Policy. The Google Analytics
            Terms of Use are available online

            Policy is available online

            practices can be found at

            Google Analytics from recognizing you on return visits to this site
            by disabling cookies on your browser.
